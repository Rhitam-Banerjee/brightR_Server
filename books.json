Some kids sculpt sandcastles. Some make mud pies. Some construct great block towers. But none are better at building than Iggy Peck, who once erected a life-size replica of the Great Sphinx on his front lawn! It's too bad that few people appreciate Iggy's talent--certainly not his second-grade teacher, Miss Lila Greer. It looks as if Iggy will have to trade in his T-square for a box of crayons . . . until a fateful field trip proves just how useful a master builder can be. A story told in verse, this is a book that shows the power of education and science. Iggy, a child who once built a great tower--in only an hour--with nothing but diapers and glue. The structured rhymes and lively illustrations fit the architectural theme, and the text uses absorbing details of Iggy's world to bring the tale to life. Each of Iggy's 16 classmates has their own unique quality, implying the variety of personalities and potentials to be appreciated in any group of children. Young readers will love their time spent with Iggy Peck. They'll love the story, colorful illustrations, and also learn about the passion and practicality of science (STEM). And now you can follow Iggy's further adventures--with his friends Rosie Revere and Ada Twist--in the instant New York Times bestseller Rosie Revere and the Raucous Riveters, a chapter book starring The Questioneers!

Rosie is presented with a challenge that she is not sure she can accomplish on her own. Through teamwork, trust and tenacity, Rosie and her friends accomplish their mission while discovering their own inner strengths. And little do they know that their new friends are on an important mission of their own!Beautifully illustrated in hand-painted watercolors, see Rosie and her friends come to life through the eyes of your younger ones.Originally written for children ages 3-9 years but appealing to 'tweens and teens, this classic story of love, patience, kindness, and tenacity will warm hearts of all ages.Reviewed by Jennifer Ibiam for Readers' Favorite(R) - April 7, 2022Eight inches of snow fell on the Callahan Farm overnight. Rosie the truck wanted to play with her friends in it. Unfortunately, they expected a storm the following night, and Farmer Jack enlisted the help of everyone to prepare for it. Rosie wasn't happy, but she helped. Later, while they were playing, Mayor Hope sent for Rosie to help bring in four reindeer trapped on a stranded train. The reindeer were on an urgent mission but couldn't brave the incoming storm. If the mission failed, many children would be sad. Would Rosie agree to help get the reindeer out of danger to a shelter? Would the storm stop the reindeer from their task? Find out in Rosie the Farm Truck by Victoria Scudder, illustrated by Kam Bayo.Rosie the Farm Truck by Victoria Scudder is a perfect Christmas children's story. However, the lessons in this picture book remain evergreen. It is a tale of kindness, teamwork, love, resourcefulness, courage, and healthy doses of confidence. I loved the beautiful illustrations and attractive choice of colors by Kam Bayo. The simple grammar and punchy sentences were catchy and easy to understand. Scudder awakened my imagination by creating living characters out of everything in the environment which I'm sure will excite children. Above all, this book reminds us never to second guess ourselves, as Rosie did. We must opt for a circle of people who would do everything to help us succeed, as we can only receive the energy we give. When we show up for people in difficult situations, we unlock another level of our own strength and uniqueness.",

          "description": "The hilarious #1 New York Times bestselling picture book about a chimpanzee in a very bad mood--perfect for young children learning how to deal with confusing feelings. Jim the chimpanzee is in a terrible mood for no good reason. His friends can't understand it--how can he be in a bad mood when it's SUCH a beautiful day? They have lots of suggestions for how to make him feel better. But Jim can't take all the advice...and has a BIT of a meltdown. Could it be that he just needs a day to feel grumpy? Suzanne and Max Lang bring hilarity and levity to this very important lesson on emotional literacy, demonstrating to kids that they are allowed to feel their feelings. Jim Panzee is back and grumpier than ever in Grumpy Monkey: Party Time and Grumpy Monkey: Up All Night!",

Reynolds entices even the stubbornly uncreative among us to make a mark -- and follow where it takes us.Her teacher smiled. Just make a mark and see where it takes you.Art class is over, but Vashti is sitting glued to her chair in front of a blank piece of paper. The words of her teacher are a gentle invitation to express herself. But Vashti can't draw - she's no artist. To prove her point, Vashti jabs at a blank sheet of paper to make an unremarkable and angry mark. There! she says. That one little dot marks the beginning of Vashti's journey of surprise and self-discovery. That special moment is the core of Peter H. Reynolds's delicate fable about the creative spirit in all of us.",
